\revise{\textbf{S1 Supplemental Methods}. Experimental details: Dimensionality reduction in retrosplenial cortex (RSC).}


\revise{\textbf{S1 Fig. \Ac{SNN} architecture used in the RSC experiment.} The \ac{SNN} had four input groups and a total of 417 excitatory input neurons (390 neurons for position, 8 for head direction, 12 for linear velocity, and 7 for angular velocity). There were a total of 600 output Izhikevich neurons, 80\% (480) excitatory neurons and 20\% (120) inhibitory neurons. Network connectivity was set at 10\% probability across all connections (inp $\rightarrow$ inh, inp $\rightarrow$ exc, inh $\rightarrow$ exc, and exc $\leftrightarrow$ exc), and each connection type was governed by its own STDPH curve (excitatory STDP on the inp $\rightarrow$ exc, inh $\rightarrow$ exc, and exc $\leftrightarrow$ exc connections, and inhibitory STDP on the inp $\rightarrow$ inh connections).}
